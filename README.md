# 🚗 Vehicle Image Classification using CNN

This project is an AI-powered vehicle recognition system that classifies vehicle images into **Car, Bike, and Bus** categories using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Streamlit

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset consists of vehicle images categorized into Car, Bike, and Bus.  
Images are split into training and testing sets and preprocessed using image normalization.

## 🧠 Model Architecture
- Convolutional layers with ReLU activation
- Max Pooling layers
- Fully connected dense layers
- Softmax output layer for multi-class classification

## 🚀 Web Application
A Streamlit web application is used to:
- Upload a vehicle image
- Perform real-time prediction
- Display predicted vehicle type


## 🌐 Deployment
The application is deployed on **Streamlit Cloud**, allowing users to access the model online for real-time predictions.
